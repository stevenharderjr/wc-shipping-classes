# Can you apply your formula to add area to each of these?

Here are the calculated **surface areas** and **estimated capacities** for USPS flat rate envelopes, using the padded-mailer capacity formula $V = k \times H^2 \times W$ with $k = 0.15$:


| Envelope | Height (in) | Width (in) | Surface Area (in²) | Estimated Capacity (in³) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Flat Rate Envelope | 9.5 | 12.5 | 118.75 | 169.22 |
| Legal Flat Rate Envelope | 9.5 | 15.0 | 142.50 | 203.06 |
| Padded Flat Rate Envelope | 9.5 | 12.5 | 118.75 | 169.22 |
| Small Flat Rate Envelope | 6.0 | 10.0 | 60.00 | 54.00 |
| Window Flat Rate Envelope | 9.5 | 12.5 | 118.75 | 169.22 |

These estimates assume **medium bubble padding** with moderate expansion (approximately 15% of height). The “surface area” shown represents the flat front face, while “capacity” reflects the approximate internal volume when filled.
