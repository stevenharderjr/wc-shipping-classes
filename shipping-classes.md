# Can you combine these into one group called shipping classes?

All the boxes and envelopes you’ve built so far can now be grouped under unified **Shipping Classes**, following USPS’s real-world classifications. These classes define how each item type is processed, priced, and limited by size and weight.[^1][^2][^4][^6]

### USPS Shipping Classes

| Shipping Class | Type | Typical Items | Max Weight | Dimensional Notes | Examples from Your Table |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **First-Class Mail** | Envelopes or small parcels | Letters, cards, thin padded mailers | 15.99 oz | Max 22" × 18" × 15" for packages, thickness < ¾" for flats | 4×8 padded envelope, Flat Rate Envelope |
| **Priority Mail Flat Rate** | USPS-provided flat-rate boxes \& envelopes | Medium to heavy items under 70 lb, prepaid packaging | 70 lb | Price fixed by packaging type, not distance; “If it fits, it ships” | Flat Rate, Legal, and Padded Envelopes; Medium and Large Flat Rate Boxes |
| **Priority Mail (Custom Dimensions)** | Non–flat-rate envelopes or boxes | Medium parcel shipments needing tracking \& speed | 70 lb | Rates vary by size, zone, and weight; includes cubic rate option | Standard Box (12×6×6), Medium Box (10×8×8), Large Box (10×10×10) |
| **Ground Advantage** | Large or lightweight parcels up to 130" combined length + girth | Bulky or heavier freight items | 70 lb | Economical shipping for oversized items; slower than Priority Mail | Could include Large Box (10×10×10) when not using flat rate |
